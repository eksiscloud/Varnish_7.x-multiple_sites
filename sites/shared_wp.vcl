## Varnish 7.7.1 default.vcl/shared_wp.vcl for multiple virtual hosts
## 
## shared_wp.vcl, same as default.vcl, is splitted in few sub vcls. Those use includes.  
## That make updating much more easier, because most of my hosts are WordPresses.
##
## This works as a standalone VCL for one WordPress host too
##  
## Lets's start caching (...and a little bit more)

# Apache2 has fallen down

## About IPs: I can't use client.ip because it is always 127.0.0.1 by Nginx (or any proxy like Apache2)
# Instead client.ip it has to be like std.ip(req.http.X-Real-IP, "0.0.0.0")
# For IP whitelisting I have X-Bypass header by Nginx and then I can do this:
# req.http.X-Bypass != "true"
