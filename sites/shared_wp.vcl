## Probes are watching if backends are healthy
## You can check if a backend is  healthy or sick:
## varnishlog -g raw -i Backend_health

#probe sondi {
    #.url = "/healthcheck.txt";  # or you can use just an url
	# you must have installed libwww-perl:
#    .request =
#      "GET /healthcheck.txt HTTP/1.1"
#      "Host: www.katiska.eu"		# It controls whole backend using one site; not the best option
#      "Connection: close"
#      "User-Agent: Varnish Health Probe";
#	.timeout = 5s;
#	.interval = 4s;
#	.window = 5;
#	.threshold = 3;
#}

## Backend tells where a site can be found

# WordPress
backend sites {
	.host = "127.0.0.1";
	.port = "8282";
	.max_connections = 5000;
	.first_byte_timeout = 300s;
	.connect_timeout = 300s;
	.between_bytes_timeout = 300s;
#	.probe = sondi;
}

# Apache2 has fallen down
backend snapshot {
	.host = "127.0.0.1";
	.port = "8383";
}

## About IPs: I can't use client.ip because it is always 127.0.0.1 by Nginx (or any proxy like Apache2)
# Instead client.ip it has to be like std.ip(req.http.X-Real-IP, "0.0.0.0")
# For IP whitelisting I have X-Bypass header by Nginx and then I can do this:
# req.http.X-Bypass != "true"
